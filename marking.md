# Marking

To mark your work I will complete the Feedback Template at the bottom of this document. I will give a general description, some suggestions for How to Improve, and then specific scores between 0-100 for the sections listed. The scores are explained in the guidance setting the Assessment.

## Thought process for marking this project

For a project like this, it would be assumed that Rachel R and Peter P approached their project:

* Working together in finding resource, sharing where they found information of value to the other.
* Doing their own exploration somewhat independently, as documented in their Documentation.
* Worked together to decide what parts of each Documentation should go into the final report, so that they both understand it.
* Worked together to decide what the figure would be and what to say about it.
* Worked independently on their reflection.

In assessing this project, I would:

* Be quite happy with the level of engagement with the question. This project definitely tries to solve the question meaningfully, without using cheats to redefine the problem as something solvable. This is a low 1st level.
* Be unimpressed by the amount of external resource that they had found and described. This is a 2:2 level.
* Be unimpressed by the detail of referencing and linking to academic material. This is again around a 2:2 level.
* Be very impressed by the amount of effort that was put into getting the code to work in an interesting and useful way. They had to do quite a lot to get the referenced code to work, which demonstrates a good understanding of both the content and how to use the internet as a resource. This is a first level.

I would assess this project as a whole in the high 60s, i.e. a good 2:1. It could have been significantly improved by a more thorough literature search which would have pushed it into the category of 1st.

* Rachel R's reflection is accurate and tries to justify the weaknesses in the project design, and also demonstrates an understanding of the cyber security data that was analysed. It is a little lacking in detail. In the context of her clearly good documentation, I would assess it as a low 70s, i.e. a low 1st.

Given the level of detail in the R script vs the python, we might think that Rachel had done more work than Peter. This might be true but it might also be the case that Peter has less coding skills. Given the project share of 50/50, as long as Peter submitted a convincing reflection they would share an equal project mark.
